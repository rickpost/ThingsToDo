<h3>Do you have a business providing activities or services in Summit County?</h3>
<h3>Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper Mountain, Frisco, Dillon, and Silverthorne</h3>
</div>
<p> In the past, companies have had to worry about their online
marketing and their offline marketing campaigns.</p>

<p >With the advent of Smartphones, the line between offline and
online becomes blurred. People can be online while on the go. With QR codes,
your printed media can be used to <strong>drive customers to your mobile website as
they are out and about</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of advertising through QR codes</strong></p>
<p>
Are you sick and tired of printing up rack cards and paying exorbitant monthly fees for somebody to travel around and keep your cards in the racks? Some of these companies charge upwards of $150/month plus you have to pay to have the material printed. With a QR code, the customers can scan a code into their phone and carry your information around with them.
</p>
<p>
It is easier for a customer to scan a QR code than to grab cards and carry them around. Chances are the cards will get thrown or blown away.
</p>
<p>
Small eye-catching signs are placed where rack cards are typically located. This will drive customers to a mobile-friendly website where they can search through the activities and services at their convenience.  
</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>
This sign is there even if your rack cards run out with no restocking fee.
</p>
<p>
There are no further design and printing costs associated with the rack cards.
</p>
<p>
QR codes are environmentally-friendly, there are no rack cards to be thrown or blown away.
</p>
<p>
This provides an incoming link to your website - good for increasing page rank and improving your SEO.
</p>
<p>
To be most effective, it is a good idea to have a mobile version of your website where the customers can be directed with their Smartphones.
</p>
<p>
Your company can be included in this cutting-edge mobile marketing campaign for a low monthly fee.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Semi-annual rates are $120/year</strong>, equivalent to $20/month for 6 months.<br />
<strong>Annual rates are $240/year</strong>.</p>
<p>
Your company can be included in additional categories for another $10 each/month. Say you rent snowmobiles in the winter and you rent ATVs in the summer. You could be listed under "Snowmobile Tours" for the semi-annual rate of $120 and under "ATV Rentals" for another $60. For only $180, you would have both of your services advertised. That's a bargain compared to the $1500+ you pay to have the printed cards stocked.
